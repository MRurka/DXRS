# I feel you

Getting out of bed is tough.

Real talk — I’ve been a “morning person” for years and **still** struggle to get out of bed. Truth is, we all do. The difference is many of us “morning people” have tricks that help us along the way.

I’m going to share with you what’s worked for me over the years. I hope some of these help you start your day on the right foot. Whether you’re _just not motivated_ or _too warm and cozy_ — I got you covered.

Get ready to catch the worm 😎

# But Why?

Let’s break it down.



## More “you” time

Early mornings are one of the best ways to get in some solid “you” time — whatever that may be. Personally, I choose to put in at least 2 hours of personal development before going in to work. What would you do?



## Uninterruptible

Nothing obligatory happens this early in the morning. No one bugs you with meetings, socials, calls or messages because you’re “sleeping”. You have a guaranteed open schedule — just for you, which is perfect for habit building.



## Tranquil

On top of having an uninterruptible, consistent window of time: This time is peaceful. The city is quiet, the sky is dim, and all you hear is the morning breeze, crisp and fresh.



## Focused

Know what else is crisp and fresh? Your brain. You’re able to think more clearly from a good nights sleep vs. post exhausting work day. This makes your “you” time even more impactful.
