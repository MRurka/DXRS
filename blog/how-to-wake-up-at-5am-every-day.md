# I feel you

Getting out of bed is tough.

Real talk — I’ve been a “morning person” for years and **still** struggle to get out of bed. Truth is, we all do. The difference is many of us “morning people” have tricks that help us along the way.

I’m going to share with you what’s worked for me over the years. I hope some of these help you start your day on the right foot. Whether you’re _just not motivated_ or _too warm and cozy_ — I got you covered.

Get ready to catch the worm 😎

# But Why?

Let’s break it down.

## More “you” time

Early mornings are one of the best ways to get in some solid “you” time — whatever that may be. Personally, I choose to put in at least 2 hours of personal development before going in to work. What would you do?

## Uninterruptible

Nothing obligatory happens this early in the morning. No one bugs you with meetings, socials, calls or messages because you’re “sleeping”. You have a guaranteed open schedule — just for you, which is perfect for habit building.

## Tranquil

On top of having an uninterruptible, consistent window of time: This time is peaceful. The city is quiet, the sky is dim, and all you hear is the morning breeze, crisp and fresh.

## Focused

Know what else is crisp and fresh? Your brain. You’re able to think more clearly from a good nights sleep vs. post exhausting work day. This makes your “you” time even more impactful.

The Early Morning Cocktail

Early mornings consist of 2/3 reason and 1/3 strategy.

* **Reason:** This is your foundation. We’ll explore a simple technique called the 5 Whys to help you dig deep and uncover your reason behind waking up early.
* **Strategy:** Using a concept called Reframing, we’ll examine common excuses for staying in bed and look at new ways to overcome them.

# Your Reason

Currently, why do you wake up at \_\_\_\_\_\__ AM?

Probably because you have to. The key word here is have to. For your new routine to stick, your internal reason must be as strong than your { external reason.

No one builds a pyramid “just because” or sculpts David’s perfect body “because I saw it in a magazine” (an analogy to your own body goals). Your reason must be meaningful.



## The 5 Whys

The 5 Whys is a simple exercise that helps uncover the root of any particular statement. Let’s see how it works.

**Initial statement: **

I have to wake up early.

**Why do you have to wake up early? **

Because I have to workout.

**Why do you have to workout?**

Because it increases my energy and reduces stress.

**Why is high energy and low stress important? **

Because it helps my productivity.

**Why is it important to be productive? **

Because there’s a lot I want to achieve, and I want to make an impact in the world.

**Why is that important to you? **

Because we live once. Let’s make the best of it.

Et voila! Try it with any reason you come up with. This is an iterative process, don’t worry about getting it right the first time. Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.



## Tip: Keep it a secret 🙊

Keeping my morning routines secret (what I do, and why) has been instrumental in building a long term habit. It’s similar to the effect of not talking about your goals until you’ve achieved them. Keeping it to yourself quickly weeds out any shallow reasons and only strengthens any meaningful reason.

Now, the fun part!

# Getting Out of Bed

Here’s where rubber meets the road. Or should I say where skin meets the … sheets? Uhh.. Nvm 😅

Let’s look at some of the most common situations using a method called reframing.

## Reframing

Simply put, reframing is an exercise that helps uncover new opportunities by identifying internal and external factors that affect any given problem. Whoa! Even simpler: Find solutions to a problem by asking: What (else) is causing or contributing to this problem?

And that’s it! To show you how it works, I’ve reframed the following situations already, so sit back and relax 💅

# Situation #1— But it’s just sooooo warm and cozy…
